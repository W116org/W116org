  Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
  Your question about the use of unleaded fuel is easy to answere:
  <br> All Mercedes-Benz cars (pre-war and post-war) have absolutely no problems with unleaded fuel.
</p>
<p>
  We recommend to use fuel with an octane rating of 98 (ROZ) for every type and also a regular control of the valve clearance, twice as much as specified by the factory. In our experience no additional lead substitute additive is necessary.
</p>
<p>
  A normal use of the car is required, of course.
</p>
<p>
  We hope this will help , please feel free to ask if you have further questions.
</p>
<p>
  Mit freundlichen Grüßen /Kind regards
</p>
