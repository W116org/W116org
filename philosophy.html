<h1>Mercedes-Benz S-Class <span class="small">Philosophy</span></h1>
<h2>Man determines the standards</h2>
<p>Today reality is millions of vehicles on crowded roads; roads that are often not all they should be. Obstructions, regulations, traffic lights, restrictions, bad weather, poor light, noise. The way the road users behave. They make mistakes, so do we - sometimes. And, above all, the fact that no two people are the same, neither physically nor emotionally.</p>
<p>These, then, are some of the more important factors which influence us all as users of the road. We have to take them into account all the time and adapt to them. They influence continuously the way we feel and how we behave.</p>
<p>But even under these conditions, motoring can still involve greater or lesser amounts of work, stress or relaxation. It is not only traffic conditions that determine the amount of stress, it is also the car you are driving.</p>
<p>Whether the car leaves you on your own with all the problems or helps you with some of the work and communicates a feeling of confidence depends on the designers' objectives. Man, his reactions and his needs, should be the fundamental factors.</p>
<p class="underline">The Mercedes-Benz concept of co-ordinated integration</p>
<p>Co-ordinated integration is firstly the thorough development of individual components, and secondly their integration into a balanced overall concept. This contrasts with less well thought-out methods of design, in which for instance some features become over-emphasised and exert undue influence on driving behaviour.</p>
<img src="/images/library/philosophy/1.headlamp.jpg" alt="Headlamp">
<p>The performance, safety, comfort and driving characteristics of the Mercedes-Benz S-class cars come together as one total entity in which all these features are matched one with another. They create the ability to cope with traffic and environmental problems and so relieve the driver of some of the stress by utilising design-features that take fully into account man's psychological and physical capabilities.</p>
<p>To see and to be seen - clearly and in plenty of time. to sit comfortably and relaxed and yet to remain alert and wide awake. To act quickly and to react correctly. To be protected from the effects of noise and vibration. To master the engine power, not be seduced by it. To exploit the car's capabilities without its overtaxing yours.</p>
<p>To have confidence in your car and so be able to concentrate all your attention on traffic and other road users and consequently on safety for everyone. That's what it's all about and today it's there for the asking. This is what the Mercedes-Benz S-class offers you.</p>

                  <h2>Economy, because of high utilisation</h2>
                  <p>There is no such thing as cheap high performance. Nevertheless Mercedes-Benz S-class cars are an economical proposition. Because economy is the benefit you get from performance in relation to what you pay for it.</p>
                  <p>Here, too, the S-class is unsurpassed.</p>
                  <p>You can cah in on the engineering concept that lies behind co-ordinated integration to such a high degree in real benefits to yourself and your fellow road users that your investment will be repaid in good measure: a saving in energy, less stain on the nerves; a feeling of relaxation plus safety and motoring enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>The more you can rely on your car, the less you have to worry. Being confident keeps you calm and an S-class car is designed specifically to reduce stress. This applies not only to such sturdy components as the engine, transmission and axles but also door hinges, screen wipers and light switches.</p>
                  <p>Further, a car built to these standards is less subject to wear and tear. Because it is only seldom pushed to the limits of what it can take. And in an S-class these design-advantages are combined with unsurpassed quality control in production, making the whole car very durable - its normal service life is appreciably longer than that of most other cars. Long service intervals and the less likely need for repairs are further proof of these robust qualities.</p>

                  <h2>Suspension developed regardless of costs for safety at high speeds</h2>
                  <p>The higher the cruising speeds the more important safety and stress reduction become. For you and for other road users.</p>
                  <p>The suspension must therefore keep you both safe and comfortable But because suspension that is too soft is less safe and if it's too hard it is uncomfortable, it is vital to achieve a balance between these two extremes. In the S-class this has been achieved. By independent suspension, by double wishbones at the front and a diagonal swing axle at the back. By using coil springs combined with double-acting telescopic gas-pressure shock absorbers.</p>
                  <p>Progressive anti-dive control on both axles prevents the car from dipping spongily during braking.</p>
                  <p>Zero-offset steering makes quite sure that the front wheels cannot be pushed off course by uneven roads. The vehicle stays steady and on its line.</p>
                  <p>Long wheelbase and wide track also contribute to active safety because with the suspension, the shock absorbers and springing in the seats they give the driver a feeling of safety and control over his car.</p>
                  <p>The unevenness of the road which is transmitted to the car is absorbed without the handling of the car being adversely affected. This is a genuine achievement and is the result of the great amount of work put into the design and careful matching of every component.</p>
                  <p>On the road, the characteristics of an S=class car are neutral with a slight tendency to understeer in critical situations. This makes it easy to control even if you have to take evasive action suddenly.</p>
                  <p>A suspension that is well balanced not only keeps the driver calm - it also provides far higher reserves of safety at higher speeds than one can expect from the average car.</p>
                  <p>The brakes are matched to the suspension and engine power. It is a very effective dual-circuit power assisted system with discs all round. The front discs are internally ventilated.</p>
